Personal kids mod.
This is a mod for my daughters to help them with Pixelmon 7.2.2 for Minecraft 1.12.2

No longer supported by Forge means I am having a hard time learning how to code. This mod is only for 1.12.2 and so far the makers of the Pixelmon mod have not updated to any other version.

I wanted to make a tree that dropped cherries for a cake my daughter designed.
I got everything coded from tutorials. However when you use bonemeal it doesnt spawn the tree.

I do not have worldgen code, only the worldgencherrytree class.
I cannot gen the tree in world gen if the tree wont gen with bonemeal in creative mode.

So far this is where im stuck.

I like the idea of variants and having more than one custom tree. But I have spend 3 days and several hours trying to code and re-code these files.

I have no idea if I am doing anything correctly as the videos I used are old, and the maker of the videos is unresponsive to help.
Also the tutorials are kinda splotchy and hard to follow.

He changed his code significantly between episodes and skipped around so it was hard to figure out some of the errors.

Maybe someone can help me, and maybe my coding mistake is easy to fix.

Thanks.
